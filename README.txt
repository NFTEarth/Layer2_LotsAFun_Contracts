# 🎟️ Raffle NFT Contracts to be deployed on L2 to gamify and engage new user bases via NFT distribution mechanisms. 

Rationale: Entering raffles on L2 is 100X more gas effective than L1, why would anyone partcipate when L2 can offer a undeniably better solution and user experience?

# NFTEarth Raffles

Inspired by the LooksRare contracts. 

## Note: These contracts are **NOT** in their final state and refinements still need to be completed before deployment. 

To Do: 

1. Smart contract testing.
2. Customize use case to NFTEarth and L2 user-base.
3. Complete a frontend similar to LooksRare for easy entry into the Rafflers, and add a native Mobile application fully integrated via Firebase in order to have Web/Android/iOS fully synchronized.
